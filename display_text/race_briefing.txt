================ PRE-RACE BRIEFING ================

* For the very last race weekend, 
  you’ve been tasked by Ferrari F1 Team 
  to be a substitute for Sebastian Vettel’s 
  race engineer due to his primary one 
  having to quarantine because of covid. 

* Vettel is up 16 points from the runner 
  up racer Lewis Hamilton, and would only 
  need to secure a 5th place finish to be 
  able to win this 5th Driver’s World Championship.

* Unfortunately for this weekend, Vettel had 
  to take a 10 place grid penalty because he 
  needed his engine to be replaced. 

* Vettel qualified on pole (1st) during Saturday 
  qualifying session, which would mean that 
  he will start in 11th place after the grid 
  penalty is applied.

* It is anticipated that Hamilton will be dominant 
  with Vettel out of the front running equation, 
  which means that he will most likely win the race 
  and score 25 points.

* With this prediction in mind, your task is to make 
  sure that Vettel finishes 5th place or higher 
  (score at least 10 points).
