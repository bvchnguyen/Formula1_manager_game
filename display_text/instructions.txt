==================== INSTRUCTIONS ====================

* Since Vettel will be starting outside the top 10, 
  you will be allowed to pick whatever tyre compound 
  you want Vettel to start with.

* You will be checking in with Vettel every 10 laps.
  Each check-in, you will instruct Vettel to:

1) Push (Go faster but consume the most fuel per lap) 
2) conserve fuel (Go slower but save more fuel per lap)
3) pit (Change to a new set of tyres but will add (1) 
        26 seconds on each time)

- During a Formula 1 race, you are allowed to only 
  have 110 kg of fuel with no refueling allowed.

- The track is very challenging on the tyres. Be sure 
  to instruct Vettel to NOT stay out too long, otherwise 
  he'll run the risk of a tyre failure.

  * SOFT Tyres has a drop off after 10 laps
  * MEDIUM Tyres has a drop off after 20 laps
  * HARD Tyres has a drop off after 30 laps

  After you hit the drop off point, the chance of a tyre
  failure will be about 1/3 -- If you Vettel does not
  experience a tyre failure, then the lap times will
  increase as the tyres now will produce less grip

- The team has predicted that if Vettel can at least 
  finish the 70 lap race within 140 minutes (or less), 
  he will finish in 5th place, thus giving him the 
  Championship.

                      Good luck!
