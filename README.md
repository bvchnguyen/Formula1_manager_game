# Formula1_manager_game

A turn-based game inspired by the role of a racer's personal engineer in the racing sport Formula 1.

## Background:

Formula 1 racing is much more than “pedal to the medal”. To win, it takes a team of dedicated engineers and strategists to determine the best variables so that their driver comes out on top on race weekends.

A formula 1 driver will have a dedicated engineer. This person is in direct communication to the driver during the race to provide him the information he needs, such as his lap-times, fuel data, tyre wear, etc.

For the very last race weekend, you’ve been tasked by Scuderia Ferrari F1 Team to be a substitute for Sebastian Vettel’s race engineer due to his primary one having to quarantine because of covid. Vettel is up 16 points from runner up to Lewis Hamilton, and would only need to secure a 5th place finish to be able to win the Driver’s World Championship. 

## Setbacks:

Unfortunately for this weekend, Vettel had to take a 10 place grid penalty as he needed his engine to be replaced. Vettel qualified on pole (1st) during Saturday qualifying session, which would mean that he will start in 11th place after the grid penalty is applied.

It is anticipated that Hamilton will be dominant with Vettel out of the front running equation, which means that he will most likely win the race and score 25 points. 

## Objective: 

Your task is to make sure that Vettel finishes 5th place or higher (score at least 10 points) to be able to secure the Championship. To do so, the team has predicted that if Vettel can at least finish the 70 lap race in 140 minutes, he will finish in 5th place.
